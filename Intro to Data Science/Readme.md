* **Assignment 2** 
	* The goal is to find the country with highest Life expectancy to GDP per capita ratio
* **Assignment 3**
	* Compare how long it takes to get the same specific outcome (i.e., rolling the same k numbers again
as one specific outcome) again with how long it takes until any previous outcome is repeated.
* **Assignment 4**
	* Write a Python function to count how often all pairs of elements co-occur in the same
cluster during repeated executions of KMeans. Store these co-occurrence counts f(i, j) in an
np.array.
 * **Assignment 5**
* **Assignment 6**
	* Implement a function to plot the residuals of a linear fit against the x-values; the linear
function is then parallel to the x-axis (see iris-regression-scaffold.py from the last
lab for inspiration).
